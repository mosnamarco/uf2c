# UF2C v0.0.1

## Built by lazy people, for lazy people (WIP 🚧)

## ✨ Current Features
- 📝 Generate commit messages using AI (because why not?)
- 📋 Create daily progress updates using the classic formats:
  - “What I did today”
  - “Challenges and How I Solved Them”

## 🛠️ TODO
- [ ] Support custom prompt creation
- [ ] Automate git add . && git commit with AI-generated commit messages
- [ ] Consider renaming the project (uf2c might be confusing)
- [ ] Refactor and reorganize project structure for better modularization

## 🤝 Contribution Guide
- Submit feature requests through pull requests or issues.

## 📌 Notes
- Still a work in progress, expect rapid changes!
- Made with maximum laziness, minimum effort. 😎
 
*UF2C — “Because even writing commit messages is too much work.”*
